                An orphan from Pith, Annabelle Sweatpea now travels with Cylia.
                Destroying her own home, and hanging out with the Adventurers seems to have changed
                Annabelle a bit. She's always down for a bloody fight, maybe even a little murder.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <div class="character-hist">
                Annabelle grew up in the small farm town called <a href="">Pith</a>, where her father
                owned the tavern, The Winking Griffon. One night, the children began to dissapear leaving
                no sign of where they had gone or why. Unbeknowst to the town, they were being preyed upon,
                by the Death Practitioner, <a href="">Jeremy</a>. Under a trance one night, she wandered into
                the swamp north of the village and found herself in the Temple of Pelor on Jeremy's operating table.
                Somehow Annabelle managed to escape and hide in a room filled with darkness and mysterious voices, she waited
                there for 2 days. Eventually she heard new voices, but before she could tell if they were friend or foe,
                she was dragged down from her hiding spot. Here she met the Adventurers and watched with stars in her
                eyes as they slayed Jeremy.<br /> After escaping the temple, she found that she had been infected by the Death Practitioner with the Black Blood Tree and was
                unwittingly used a suicide bomber. She was rescued by Cylia, and now she travels with her as they complete missions
                for the Order of Doors.
